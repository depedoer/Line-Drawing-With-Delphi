Line-Drawing-With-Delphi
========================
Demonstrates how to draw a building map onto a delphi canvas, using straight lines to signify walls, and adding buttons to indicate individual rooms.

Main Features:
  * Lines drawn by a drag and click method onto the canvas
  * A snap to grid button allows the lines to be snapped to the nearest 10pixel location
  * Rectangles can be added to the canvas to signify rooms, these change colour when clicked with a mouse
  * An undo button uses a queing algorithm to undo up to the last 10 items added to the canvas.
